#Trinket for Under Cabinet lighting.

This is a simple bit of arduino code (suitable for something as small as a trinket) to drive an LED strip via MOSFET/PWM. I use them under my cabinets.

The control is a single button. Press and hold to start the fade release and press again to reverse the direction of fade.

It's really that simple.
